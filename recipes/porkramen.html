        <LI>Remove from heat and use a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder to grind rice to a fine powder. Mix the 2 teaspoons of the rice powder with the remaining dressing ingredients.</LI>
        <LI> Place a non-stick pan over high heat. When it’s hot, add in the pork mince and ¼ cup of water. Break up the mince as it cooks. </LI>
        <LI>Cook the noodles according to packet instructions. Divide among serving bowls. Top with the pork mixture and sprinkle over extra herbs and toasted rice powder.</LI>
        <LI>Using glutinous or sticky rice will give you a softer rice powder that creates a thick and soft coating for the finished salad. </LI>
