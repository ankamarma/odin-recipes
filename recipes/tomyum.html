    <p>HOW TO MAKE TOM YUM SOUP:</p>
    <P>At first sip of this Thai tom yum soup, you'll be overcome by the intoxicating flavors of lemongrass, garlic, lime, 
        coconut milk, and chile combined with a chicken stock base and topped off with shrimp. </P>
    <P>If you like spice, we recommend either fresh red chiles or getting yourself a bottle of chile oil and adding anywhere from a few drops to a few teaspoons.
         Or leave the chile out for a terrific mild tom yum.</P>
