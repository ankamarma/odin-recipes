    <p>HOW TO MAKE PUMPKIN SOUP:</p>
    <P>Instead of the usual autumn spices like cinnamon and nutmeg, this pureed pumpkin soup was inspired by Thai flavors. It's made especially creamy with the addition of coconut milk, while the Thai red curry paste and garlic lend depth and heat. Lemongrass, ginger, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice brighten the flavors in each spoonful. If you want a touch more heat, add extra sliced Fresno chiles as a garnish.
